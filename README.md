# Project Title :
Machine Learning-Time-Series-Furniture-Sales-Forecasting-Project.

## Project Overview :
This Machine Learning project is focused on forecasting the sales of a furniture store. 
In this project, we delved into time series analysis, exploring various techniques to predict sales and optimize inventory for sustained business operations.
The goal is to accurately forecast furniture sales for the next year, ensuring an optimal customer experience and maintaining store sustainability.
For a retail furniture store, predicting future sales is critical to avoid inventory issues and ensure optimal customer experience. 
The challenge is to utilize time series data to accurately forecast furniture sales for the next year. This predictive insight helps avoid losses and maintain the sustainability of the store.

## Project Highlights :

-**Checking Components of Time Series:** Identifying and analyzing the various components of time series data, such as trends and seasonality.
-**Forecasting Techniques:** Utilizing a range of time series forecasting techniques to predict furniture sales for the next year.
-**Visualization in Time Series:** Applying visualization techniques to better understand time series data.
-**EDA on Dataset:** Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover initial insights.
-**Visualizing Time Series Data:** Creating visualizations to explore and better understand the time series data.
-**Stationarity Testing - ADFULLER:** Conducting stationarity tests using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to determine if the time series data is stationary.
-**Seasonal Decomposition:** Decomposing the time series data into seasonal, trend, and residual components.
-**Splitting Data - X_train, X_test:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the forecasting model.
-**Forecasting - ARIMA (p,d,q) and Seasonality (P,D,Q):** Applying ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models to forecast future sales.
-**Predicted Sales vs Real Sales:** Comparing the predicted sales with the actual sales to evaluate the model's performance.
-**RMSE:** Calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the forecasting model.
-**Visualizing:** Visualizing the forecasting results and evaluating the performance of the model.
